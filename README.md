## iOS Prework - Sathwik Yanamaddi

### App Description
This app is a beginner app made for iOS.

This is my first ever IOS Application. Although this app is fairly simple, building it was fun and I did encounter some obstacles. First off, I would make simple mistakes such as forgetting to update the reference to the update variables that I created. Also, I ran into trouble updating all of the labels and values of the sliders. Overall, I think this was a great starter project and I can't wait to learn more.
